This is just a tiny project I made in class, i thought it was actually useful if someone pulls that BS at dinner where they either dont want to pay and looks around buffering to see if someone will offer or if someone who you dont want to owe later offers and insists on paying. 

Since this is a project that is a regular homework assignment in many python classes i dont care if you copy it. Theres better versions everywhere lol.
